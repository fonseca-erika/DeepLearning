# Neural Style Transfer

Neural Style Transfer refers to a class of software algorithms that manipulate digital images, or videos, to adopt the appearance or visual style of another image. NST algorithms are characterized by their use of deep neural networks in order to perform the image transformation. Common uses for NST are the creation of artificial artwork from photographs, for example by transferring the appearance of famous paintings to user supplied photographs.

The principle of the algorithm is to take advantage of feature extraction of CNNs. We get the features from the content picture and the texture from the style picture, and combining these two elements.
